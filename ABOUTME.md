Hello,

My name is Alex and I learning to become involved in a role consisting of exploring data through Python, Pandas & matplotlib.

I started my coding journey in mid-2019, starting with HTML, CSS & JS including React.  
During COVID, I realised that I was losing motivation based on neverending projects on top of being stuck in the house all day.  During this time, I explored [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/aed1988) and really enjoyed the puzzle based nature of their challenges.  I realised that what I enjoyed was working through problems and coming to a solution and reviewing to see if this can be improved upon.
I felt it was time for a change and to lean on what I've always been good at, Mathematics.  I re-started my [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/aed1988) journey and went down the Data Scientist path.  Being able to re-learn conecpts and using them to display data in clear and professional graph has been invigorating and being able to work on projects that I'm interest in or have a meaningful benefit to my like/work.  

What continues to motivate me is the dream of working in a fast paced, ever-changing environment as part of a team to complete projects.  Learning more and more about alternative or evolving technologies.  

I may not have taken the usual root into this line of work, but I will work as hard as anyone to develop my career in programming.

If you would like to contact me, my email is aed1988@gmail.com.
