Hello,

My name is Alex and I learning to become a web developer.

I started my coding journey in mid-2019, starting with HTML, CSS & JS, but I have really taken to React.  I enjoy the component nature of it and ease at which you can build scalable websites.  

My journey has not been smooth sailing, COVID, the struggles of self-teaching and working on infinite projects for the sake of working on them have been the main issues.  This hasn't stopped me from progressing and motivating myself to reach where I want to be.

What continues to motivate me is the dream of working in a fast paced, ever-changing environment as part of a team to complete projects.

If you would like to contact me, my email is aed1988@gmail.com.
